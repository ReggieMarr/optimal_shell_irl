+ Materials:
  The Verglas Infinity uses a mix of recycled polyester and polyester, while the Odin 1 uses 100% Polyamide, and the Odin 9 uses 100% Polypropylene. The materials can influence the feel, durability, and potentially the breathability and waterproofness of the jackets. Polypropylene tends to be more durable and resistant to abrasion compared to polyester, and polyamide is generally more durable and has a better feel compared to polypropylene.
+ Weight:
  The Odin 1 is the lightest at 450g, followed by the Verglas Infinity at 500g, and the Odin 9 is the heaviest at 550g. Even though the differences are minor, they could potentially impact comfort and ease of movement during long-term use, especially in activities that involve a lot of motion like snowboarding or hiking. A lighter jacket might feel less cumbersome.
+ Articulatibility:
  All jackets feature articulated sleeves for optimal mobility, providing excellent freedom of movement for arms which is especially useful in activities like snowboarding or sailing.
+ Style:
  You've mentioned that the Odin 9 is the most stylish, followed by the Odin 1, and the Verglas Infinity is the least stylish. This is of course subjective and dependent on personal preferences. The look of a jacket might not impact its performance, but could affect your satisfaction and enjoyment of using it.
+ Technology:
  The Verglas Infinity and Odin 1 use LIFA INFINITY™ technology while the Odin 9 uses the slightly superior LIFA INFINITY PRO™ technology. The LIFA INFINITY PRO™ is expected to provide slightly better waterproofness without the need for a re-application of DWR later on.
+ Pockets:
  The Odin 1 and Odin 9 both have chest pockets, while the Verglas Infinity does not. The Odin 9 has larger front pockets compared to the Odin 1, while the Verglas Infinity has two large front pockets as well. This could impact the functionality and convenience of the jackets, particularly for activities where easy access to items (like maps, compass, phone, etc.) stored in pockets is important.
